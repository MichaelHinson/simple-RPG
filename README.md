# simple-RPG
A simple text-based RPG I was working on while learning classes in c++.
This is also my first time attempting to use git and github as a source control solution.
Currently the project is composed of Rpg refactoring.cpp, Character.h, FightFunctions.h, and GameState.h.

It also contains quite a few older versions that were located in the folder as my own early attempts at source control.
